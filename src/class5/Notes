Logical operators:
     Help us place combine multiple conditions
     on the same line in if statements;
Types of logical operators:
- NOT (!)
- OR (||)
- AND (&&)

NOT(!):
True=>false
false=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
      1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
      2) The code readability will increase


OR(||):
     Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions
     in such a way that as soon as one condition gets true the
     whole condition will be evaluated to true

 true||false||true - true
 false||false||false -false
 true||true||true-true


 AND(&&):
         Logical  AND operator will help us combine the conditions
         in such a way that it will only give us true of all the conditions are true
false && false && false - false
true && true && true - true
true && true && false - false
