Type casting:
 Type casting is converting data from one to another data type;
 E.g. we can convert int to float or other way around'
 There are two types:
 1)Implicit/Auto/Widening
 2)Explicit/Manual/Narrowing

 int number=(int)10.5;
Type casting works only with primitive data types

===================================================================
If statements:
     are part of the conditional constructs ()in java.
     They help us write code that can be executed based on condition
     There are many variations of if statements:
     -if
     -if else
     -else if
     -nested if


Why do we need conditional statements?
  Without the if statements programs will always generate the same output no matter what.

Syntax:
if(condition){
Something that we want to execute if the condition is true
}else{
Something that we want to execute if the condition is false
}


Note:
Whenever it is possible to write code with else if and multiple if conditions,
ALWAYS go with else if conditions;


NESTED if condition are created to check condition that is dependent on another condition

With primitive data types we can use ><!=== etc;
But6 with on primitives we have to use .equals method!
