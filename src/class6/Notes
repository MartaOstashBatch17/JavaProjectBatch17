Operators:
Operators are symbols  to perform an operation on data.
Types:

* Arithmetic Operators - help us perform simple mathematical operations-
     -addition +
     -subtraction -
     -multiplication *
     -division /
     -modulus %

* Shorthand Operators - perform the same operations but make is easier,
using little shorter syntax
     -add and update a variable += (eg int a=10, a+=20 , a=30);
     -subtract and update a variable -= (eg int a=10, a-=20 , a=-10);
     -multiply and update a variable *= (eg int a=10, a*=20 , a=200);
     -divide and update a variable /= (eg int a=10, a/=20 , a=0); //it's int that's why the answer is 0
     -modulus and update a variable %= (eg int a=10, a%=20 , a=10); //if the value is smaller it will always be the answer, pizza example


* Relational Operators - these operators help us to compare things:
     == checks is two objects are equal
     != checks is two objects are not equal
     > grater than
     < les than
     >= grater than equal to
     <= less than equal to

* Logical operators - help us to combine multiple boolean conditions
     ! NOT
     || OR
     && AND

* Increment/decrement operators:
     ++ this will help us to increase the value of a variable by 1
     -- this will help us to decrease the value of a variable by 1

 While loop checks the cond first then executes teh code
 Do While executes the code and then checks the condition

  Sometimes when we write the logic using do while it becomes easier.
  There are no other differences and reasons to use a do while instead of while
