    version- every time there is some modification, it creates a new version of a code;

    git - version control system that help us to save different version of the code in the local repository;
    local repository is - storage on your computer
     We need git to manage different versions of code effectively;

    Why do we need github?-for the backup and to share the code with coworkers,
    What is Git HUb- remote repo(online storage)


    Why do we need terminal/'gitbash?
    -to give commands to git, communicate with git

    What commands git understands?
    git is a sw that understands unix based commands (unix is oc)


    In order to write unix based commands you need git bash, on mac- you need terminal


    pwd - tells u the CURRENT location of terminal print working directory

    ls - list, shows you the directories that are available in the folder that you're standing in
    cd--> change the folder/directory;

    cd ..--> move back one step

    cd ~--> to navigate your terminal to home directory

    the best place to create repository is PROJECT folder

    Steps:
    1. find the location of your project (next to project name in Intelij)
    2. open terminal
    3. check where your terminal is - pwd
    4.follow the path of your project and navigate using commands like cd, pwd, ls
    5. make sure that you have successfully navigated to the right location -- pwd, the path should match the path of the project
