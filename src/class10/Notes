OOP Object Oriented Programing:
     It's just a way of writing code (set of rules)of writing code.
     It basically helps us write large amounts of code, which we can manage easily as well.
     That is easier to change and manage. There are other ways , like we have functional and
     procedural programing.
Why should we use OOP?
     1) It helps us write large amounts of code easily
     2) Also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
     3) Changing code becomes easier.
     4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier
Main Concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
     1) Classes and Objects
     2) Inheritance
     3) Polymorphism
     4) Abstraction
     5) Encapsulation
Classes and Objects:
     A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start
     building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes which help us
     figure out how smth looks like and they have behaviours/methods/functions
     which help us understand how smth works and behaves
