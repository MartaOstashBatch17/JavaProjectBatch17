Nested loops:
     A nested loop is  a loop inside another loop. Nested loops are used to solve
     complex problems in which we have nested data or we need to perform nested
     iterations. We can nest a for loop inside a while loop or a for loop inside
     another for loop.
Why nested loops?-
     We will need them to read nested data, to go through multiple
     pages and from each page we might want to go through multiple tems.
Syntax:
     for (int i=0; i<10;i++){
      for (int j=0; j<10;j++){
         }
      }

Arrays:
     help us store multiple objects of the same time in just one variable.
     They are index based data structures.
     Every item we store inside an array, is assigned a number that is called index.
     Whenever we want to get any value from the array, we provide that index.
Why we should use arrays?
     WE can use multiple variables as well tto store multiple items.
     But when the data is large, it's almost impossible to handle the variables.
     Imagine we have to store the names of all the ppl  living in NYC.
Syntax:
     There are 2 ways of creating an array:
     1) DataType [] arrayName={element1, element2...};
     E.g. int[]ages={23,25,28,33,20};
     2) DataType[] arrayName=new DataType[size];
     E.g int[]ages=new int[5];
     ages[0]=25;
     ages[1]=25;
     ages[2]=45;
     ages[3]=75;
     ages[4]=22;
     ages[5]=21;
