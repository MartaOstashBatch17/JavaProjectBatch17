Arrays:
      Arrays are data structures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
      Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them,we can access/request/update the value.
      Indexes always start from 0.
Why should we use Arrays?
      Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily with the help of loops
      When we have more than 3 similar items that we want to store nd process together,
      we should always go with Arrays.
Syntax:
      There are two ways of creating arrays:
      Method1:
      DataType[]nameOfTheArray={element1, element2, element3};
      Method2:
      DataType[]nameOfTheArray=new DataType[Size];
Enhanced for loop:
      Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through data structures
      which have multiple data stored inside of them.
Why should we use Enhanced for loop>
      It's simple an easy to understand.
Syntax:
      for(DataTYpeOfElement anyVarName:nameOfTheArray)
Limitations of Enhanced for loop:
      1)Enhanced for loop can not be used for updating teh elements;
      2)Access the elements in the reverse order;
Break:
      Break keyword is used in switch case statements and with the loops to
      terminate the loops prematurely
Why should we use it?
      It will help us to save a lot of processing time and our code
      can execute faster
Continue:
      Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop, once we hit
      continue keyword ,Java ignores the rest of the code in loop and
      jumps to the next iteration
